________________________________________
## 1. Classification
Types of Malware:
- Virus
- Trojan Horse
- Rootkit
- Bootkit
- Backdoor
- Adware
- Spyware
- Greyware
- Dialer
- Key-logger
- Botnet
- Ransomware
- Data-stealing malware
- Worm

________________________________________
#### A. Virus
Computer virus is a computer program that copies itself and spreads without permission or knowledge of the owner.

Virous do not spread via exploiting vulnerabilities (the ones that do that are called worms)

The only way viruses are supposed to spread is with the host - at least in their rigorous classification.

Let us say, that a virus has infected a file; now if the owner moves the file to any system, the virus has thus a chance to spread and survive.

Viruses can be classified into the following sub-types:
- Resident type
  which when executed becomes memory resident (and waits for some triggers such as loading of other program). It then infects other program and so on.
- Non-resident type
  once a virus is executed, it will search for files it can infect. Then after infecting them, it will quit. When the infected program is run again, it will again find new targets and so on.
- Boot-sector virus
  which spreads via boots sectors. For example, if a user leaves a infected CD-ROM while turning off a system, the next time system will boot-up, the boot sector virus will activate and will thus spread to the hard-disk which will then spread it to another disks / flash-drives. When disk / flask-drives disks are moved, the cycle gets repeated.
- Multi-partite type
  The virus has several types of infection mechanisms such as they can have both Boot-sector and resident type virus or even more.
_______________________________________
#### B. Trojan Horse
Trojan horse is a kind of malware that appears to the user to perform a function but in-fact facilitates unauthorized access to the owner's system.

They are not self-repeating like viruses.

_______________________________________
#### C. Rootkit
Rootkit is a malware which is designed to hide the fact that a compromise has already been done or to do the compromise at a deeper level.

A rootkit is basically used as a supplement to other malware.

Basically, rootkits can be used to hide processes, files on the system, implement backdoors and/or create loopholes.

Rootkit exist for all major operating systems such as Windows, Linux, Solaris, OS X, etc.

They are basically installed as drivers (or kernel modules).

Rootkits are known to exits at the following levels (even at lower levels possibly):
- Application level
  They replace actual program with copies of other programs
- Library level
  Let us say that 10 applications are sharing a library, taking control of the library means taking control of all 10 apps
- Kernel level
  This is the most common type and was first developed by Greg Hoglund around 1999 for Windows NT. They are known for their resistance to removal since they run at the same privilege level at which Anti-Virus solutions are run
- Hypervisor level
  These days, processor have come up with support for virtualization. Rootkits which use such processor-specific technologies are called hyper-visor rootkits. E.g., blue-pill and subvirt.
- Firmware level
  Rootkits for firmware such as BIOS, ACPI tables or device ROMSS are known to exist. They have the highest chance of survival because currently, no tools exist to verify/scan up the firmware level rootkits.

_______________________________________
#### D. Bootkit
Bootkits are rootkits which grabs the OS during the boot process itself and were introduces by Nitin Kumar and Vipin Jumar in 2007 (author of this section).

They differ from the rootkits in the installation process and how they take control of the OS.

They start attacking the OS when the OS has not even started, so they are able to completely violate the security of the target OS.

_______________________________________
#### E. Backdoor
Backdoor is a software (or modification to the software) which help in bypassing authentication mechanism, keeping remote access open (for later unauthorized purpose) which trying to remain hidden.

For example, a backdoor in a login system might give you access when a specifies username/password is entered, even though they might not be a valid combination.

_______________________________________
#### F. Adware
Adware is basically advertising supported software which displays ads from time-to-time during the use of the software.

Some adware also act as spyware. Adware also install other unwanted software on the users system which might/might not be malware. This is done without the consent of the user.

_______________________________________
#### G. Spyware
Spyware is a software which keeps on spying the user's activities such as collecting user information, his website visiting record and other information without the consent of the user.

This information is sent to the author after a certain amount has been collected.

They are also called privacy-violating software or privacy-invading software.

Normally, a system which has spyware also has other kinds of malware such as rootkits/trojans to hide the tracks and to keep in control of the machine.


_______________________________________
#### H. Greyware
**Greyware** is a collective name for spyware and adware. A greyware can be either spyware or adware or both.

_______________________________________
#### I. Dialer
Dialer is a software which is used to connect to the internet but instead of using normal numbers, they connect to premium numbers which are charged highly.

Thus the owner  of the dialer who has setup the stuff makes bug sums of money.

_______________________________________
#### J. Key-logger
Key-loggers are malware which log down key pressed by the key owner without their consent. Thus, the person is unaware that his actions are being monitored.

For example, a person might type his credit-card numbers which might them be misused by the keylogger creator.

There are numerous kinds and methods of keylogging such as:
- Software keylogger
  kernel mode or user mode keyloggers
- Hardware keylogger
  firmware-based keylogger can be put in BIOS

  PS/2 and USB keyboards can be sniffed with an additional device placed between the keyboard port and CPU.
- Wireless keyboard sniffer
  Passive sniffers can be used to collect keyboard data in case of wireless keyboards
- Acoustic keylogger
  These kinds of keylogger are based on the sound made when a key is struck by the user

  After sometime of data logging, clear patterns can be distinguished when a key is pressed or released which leads to remote passive keylogging
- Optical keylogger
  Optical keylogging is done by a person standing beside you or by a camera.
_______________________________________
#### K. Botnet
Botnet refers to a collection of compromised computers which run commands automatically and autonomously (with the help of command and control server).

Botnets are typically created when a number of clients install the same malware.

This is usually done via drive-by-downloads (drive-by-download means a compromised website will try to exploit your web browser and install a software without user consent).

The controller or owner of the botnet is called a bot master and is usually the one who gives commands to the bots.

Botnets are used by the botmaster for reasons such as distributed denial of service (DDOS), sending SPAM, etc.

_______________________________________
#### L. Ransomware
This is a software which locks down important files with a password then demands from the user to send money and in return promises to unlock the files.

The most famous example being gpcode which used public-key cryptography to encrypt the user files.

_______________________________________
#### M. Data-stealing malware
Data stealing malware basically steals data such as private encryption keys, credit-card data, competitors data such as internal secret algorithms, new product designs, and other internal data which could be used by the 3rd party to cause damage to the original data owner.

Some of these are highly targeted attacks and are never detected.

_______________________________________
#### N. Worm
Worms are basically software which use network/system vulnerabilities to spread themselves from system to system.

They are typically part of other software such as rootkit and are normally the entry point into the system.

They basically compromise the system (locally or remotely) and then provide access to other software such as bot clients, spyware, key-loggers, and so on.

_______________________________________
## 2. Techniques Used by Malware
The most important covert methods are:
- Streams
- Hooking native APIs/SSDT
- Hooking IRP

Theses topic are highly moving targets with new methods/techniques invented every new months.

_______________________________________
#### 2.1. Streams
Streams are a feature of NTFS file system, they are not available on FAT file systems.

Microsoft calls them Alternate Data Stream.

The original data stream is file dat itself (it is the data stream with no name), all other streams have a name. Alternate data streams can be used to store file metadata / or any other data.

To explain the concept, let us give you a demo. The demo has been tested on Windows XP SP3 (but should work flawlessly on other Windows NT based OS too)

**Example:**
1. Type the following command in the command prompt:
```
echo This data is hidden in the stream. Can you read it?

>> sample.txt:hstream
```

Now you can check the file named `sample.txt`.

You will be surprised to see that the file size is reported as 0 bytes. You can retrieve back your data by using the following command:
```
more < sample.txt:hstream
```

2. Now let us explain how to use the stream programmatically.

In the **CreateFile** API in Windows, just append `:stream_name` to the file name, where `streamname` is the name of the stream.

```
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void main(){
  hStream = CreateFile( "sample.txt:mystream",
    GENERIC_WRITE,
    FILE_SHARE_WRITE,
    NULL,
    OPEN_ALWAYS,
    0,
    NULL);
  if (hStream == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
    printf("Cannot open sample.txt:mystream\n");
  else
    WriteFile(hStream,"This data is hidden in the stream. Can you Read IT ???", 53, &dwRet, NULL);
}

```

_______________________________________
#### 2.2. Hooking Native API/SSDT
**Hooking** means that we want our malicious function to be called instead of the actual function

SSDT stands for System Service Descriptor Table. Native API is API which resides in ntdll.dll and is basically used to **communicate with kernel mode**.

This communication happen using SSDT table.

For each entry in SSDT table, there is a suitable function in kernel mode which completes the task specified by the API; this representation can be pictured as:

User mode Native API|<===>|SSDT Table|<===>|Kernel Mode
-----|---|---|---|----|

SSDT table resides in the kernel and is exported as **KeServiceDescriptorTable**. The following are the services available for reading/writing file:
- **NtOpenFile**
- **NtCreateFile**
- **NtReadFile**
- **NtWriteFile**
- **NtQueryDictionaryFile** (This is used to query content of the directory)

Microsoft keeps on adding new services on every OS release.

**Example:**
Let us consider the case of a directory query.

For that, we have to hook **NtQueryDictionaryFile**

Steps:
1. Hook SSDT table entry corresponding to  **NtQueryDictionaryFile**
2. Now, whenever the above function is called, your function will be called
3. Right after your function gets called, call original function and get its result (directory listing)
4. If the result was successful, modify the results (hide the file/sub-directory you want to hide)
5. Now pass back the result to the caller
6. You are hidden

This is a very basic method. Nowadays almost all anti-virus / rootkit-detectors scan SSDT table for modifications (they compare it with the copy stored in the kernel) and thus detection can be done.

_______________________________________
#### 2.3. Hooking IRP
Windows architecture in kernel mode introduced the concepts or IRPs (I/O Request Packets) to **transmit piece of data from one component (driver) to another**.

The concept of IRPs is well explained in the Windows Driver Development Kit (it is available for free)

Almost everything in windows kernel use IRPs. For example network interface (TCP/UDP, etc.), file system, keyboard and mouse, and almost all existent drivers.

There are basically 2 ways to play with IRPs:
- Become a filter driver
  Register with the OS as a filter driver or an attached device
- Hooking the function pointer
  the array that can be shown with Winddk (about the function pointer can be modified)

  Code snipper showing function pointer hooking:
  ```
  old_power_irp = DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_OWER];
  DriverObject->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_OWER] = my_new_irp
  ```

  As you can see, function pointer is one of the easiest method to hook functions.

The basic IRP design is so that after an IRP has been created, it is passed to all the devices registered at lower levels.

The design has pre-processing mode and post-processing mode.

Pre-processing is done when an IRP arrives and post-processing is done when the IRP has been processed by all the levels below the current level.

Each device object has its own function table. Hooking the function pointers of such objects is called DKOM (Direct Kernel Object Manipulation).

All file systems, network layers, devices like keyboard, mouse, etc. have such objects.

For example:
- `\device\tcp`
- `\device\ip`
- `\Device\KeyboardClass0`
- `\FileSystem\ntfs`

Filer drivers are basically used by Anti-viruses to get control whenever a new file is written.

_______________________________________
#### 2.4. Hiding a Process
Hiding a process requires a more difficult approach. It requires a combination of different techniques.

E.g., first thing you have to do is to hook NtOpenProcess native API (probably using SSDT table hooks).

Other things to do is to hide process from EPROCESS list.

This list is maintained by the OS for all active processes.

The EPROCESS list has the following structure:
```
kd> dt _EPROCESS
    +0x000 Pcb                : _KPROCESS
    +0x06C ProcessLock        : _EX_PUSH_LOCK
    +0x070 CreateTime         : _LARGE_INTEGER
    +0x078 ExitTime           : _LARGE_INTEGER
    +0x080 RundownProtect     : _EX_RUNDOWN_REF
    +0x084 UniqueProcessId    : Ptr32 Void
    +0x088 ActiveProcessLinks : _LIST_ENTRY
    +0x090 QuotaUsage         : [3] Uint48
    ...
    +0x0C4 ObjectTable        : Ptr32 _HANDLE_TABLE
    +0x0C8 Token              : _EX_FAST_REF
    ...
    +0x174 ImageFileName      : [16] Uchar

```

Note : UniqueProcessId, ActiveProcessLinks, Token, and ImageFileName are normally most used

As you can see in the above  structure, **ActiveProcessLinks** is the circular doubly linked list with \*FLINK and \*BLINK as pointers to other structures.

The easiest thing to do is to unlink the structure relative to our process from the list (Refer to Module 3 for more information on this list).

If the driver is loaded, you will also have to unlink it form the **PsLoadedModuleList**.

API hooking is essentially the act of intercepting an APIP function call, and modifying its functionality somehow, either by redirecting it to a function of our choice, stopping the function from being called, or logging the request - the possibilities are endless.

_______________________________________
#### 2.5. API Hooking
There can be different types of hooking such as:
- IAT Hooking
  IAT (Import Address Table) is used to **resolve runtime dependencies**

  For example, when you use **MessageBoxA** API in windows, your compiler automatically links to *user32.dll*

  IAT hooking involves modifying the IAT table of the executable and replace the function with our copy

- EAT Hooking
  EAT (Export Address Table) is maintained in DLLs (dynamic link library).

  These files just contain **support function** for other executable files.

  Difference between IAT and EAT hooking is:
  - Since EATs exist only in DLL files (under normal settings) most of the times EAT hooking is utilized only on DLLs while IAT hooking can be done on both EXEs and DLLs.

- Inline Hooking
  Inline hooking is the most difficult to do due to the way it works

  In this form of hooking, we modify the first few bytes of the target function code and replace them with our code which tells the IP (instruction pointer) to execute code somewhere else in memory.

  Whenever the function gets executed, we will get control of execution; after doing our job, we have to call the original function so we have to fix up the modified function.

  This is normally done by executing a number of instructions which were replaced and then resuming execution in non-modifies original function code.

_______________________________________
#### 2.6. Anti-Debugging Methods
There are several methods which are used by malware to increase the time required to analyze the code (by security analyst)

If such techniques are not already known by security analyst then the time required increases drastically.

**For example:**
We will document a trick that lets us detect the presence of a running debugger. It is called INT 2D trick and works flawlessly on Windows OS.

This trick is coded in assembly language.

Clear SEH.


```
push debugger_not_detected
push fs:[0]                 set SEH
mov  fs:[0],esp
int   2dh                   If debugger is attached it will run normally, else an exception will be returned.

nop                         
The above instruction causes it to skip this instruction if debugger is attached.

pop  fs:[0]                 clear SEH
add esp,4
...
debugger_detected :
...
debugger_not_detected:
```

What we do is:
1. Set an exception handler
2. Cause an exception with **INT 2dh**
3. If a debugger is attached and does not pass the exception to us we get to **debug_detected** because an exception occurred for sure (we caused it)
_______________________________________
#### 2.7. Anti-Virtual Machine
Normal users always run the programs on a real system but security analyst analyzing malwares do not run the malware on a real system.

They always run the code in virtualized OS.

The tools are VMWare, Virtual PC, Xen, bochs, qemu to name a few.

These software let you install a virtual OS side-by-side your OS (without disturbing your OS) and will run just like any normal program.

These techniques are basically used by security analyst, so malware authors have found out few bugs in these applications which can be used to detect whether the OS is virtualized or not.

One of the trick is given in the code below
```
text:10007126 ; |||||| SUBROUTINE |||||
text:10007126
text:10007126
text:10007126 Ant1_Emulation_SIDT_Based_Check proc near ; CODE XREF: DllMa1n(x,x,x)+16ip
text:10007126      call Get_IDT_base
text:10007126       
text:10007120      and  eax, 0FF000000h
text:10007122      xor ecx, ecx
text:10007127      cmp  eax, 80000000h : Real Windows Machine always have 0x80 for their MSB
text:1000712A      setnz cl
text:1000712C      mov  eax, ecx       : If EAX!=0 we are emulating windows
text:1000712C      retn
text:1000712C      Ant1_Emulation_SIDT_Based_Check endp
text:1000712C
```

The techniques basically work on the SIDT instruction, which returns the IDT table address.

On real machines, it is in low memory less than 0xd0 while for virtualized OS (VMware/Virtual PC), it is higher than that.

This abnormal behavior leads to detection whether the malware is running on a real or virtualized system.
_______________________________________
#### 2.8. Obfuscation
Code obfuscation techniques transform/change a program in order to make it more difficult to analyze while preserving functionality.

Code obfuscation is used both by malware and legal software to protect itself.

The difference is that malware use it to either to prevent detection or make reverse engineering more difficult.

Basically code obfuscation/data obfuscation makes programs more difficult to reverse engineering.

One major drawback of existing obfuscating techniques is the lack of theoretical basis about their efficiency (Several implementation which looked impressive had very basic weak points, leading to their total downfall).

The malware obfuscates itself every time it infects a new machine making it harder for a detector to recognize it.

Existing malware detectors (Anti-virus Engines) are based on signature matching, thus they are based on purely syntactic information and can be fooled by such techniques.

_______________________________________
#### 2.9. Packets
Packers are software which compress the executable. They were initially designed to decrease the size of executable files.

However, the malware authors recognized very quickly that decreasing number of patterns in the file, so less chances of detection by anti-virus.

Anti-virus basically work by matching patterns (signatures).

So, this effectively increases the chances of malware to go undetected.

Some virus writers have gone to limit of creating their own packers (such as Yoda packer) while others user readily available packers such as UPX.

Some packers use anti-debugging tricks also.

Packer facts:
- Packer allow to compress/encrypt applications
- You cannot see the code of the application using a disassembler,  you need to unpack it first
- Packers compress applications and add a small loader to the file
- The loader will decompress the binary in memory, resolve import, and call the Original Entry Point (OEP)

_______________________________________
#### 2.10. Polymorphism
Polymorphic code aims at performing a given action (or algorithm) through code that mutates and changes every time the action has to be taken.

The mutation makes them very difficult to detect.

There have been only a few polymorphic viruses and they still are not detected 100% by most of the anti-viruses.

All polymorphic viruses have a constant encoding and variable decryptor. So a virus using a different XOR key to encrypt its variant also falls into polymorphic category.

_______________________________________
#### 2.11. Metamorphism
It can be described as polymorphism with polymorphism applied to the decryptor/header as well.

There are numerous ways to implement metamorphism/polymorphism (both are similar with some minor differences).

Some of which are documentation below:
- Garbage Insertion
- Register Exchange
- Permutation of Code Blocks
- Insertion of Jump Instructions
- Instruction Substitution
- Code Integration with Host

###### 2.11.1. Garbage Insertion
Garbage Insertion : Garbage data/instruction are inserted into the code, for example NOP instructions (0x90) are inserted.

###### 2.11.2. Register Exchange
Register Exchange : The registers are exchanged in all the instructions.

For example, see the 2 snippets of code given below which are using register exchange.

**Fist Snippet**

Code Bytes   | Disassembly
-------------|------------
5A           | pop edx
BF04000000   | mov edi, 0004h
8BF5         | mov esi, ebp
B80C000000   | mov eax, 0000Ch
81C222000000 | add edx, 0088h
8B1A         | mov ebx, [edx]


**Second Snippet**

Code Bytes   | Disassembly
-------------|------------
58           | pop eax
B804000000   | mov ebx, 004h
8BD5         | mov edx, ebp
BF0C000000   | mov edi, 000Ch
81C88000000  | add eax, 0088h
8B30         | mov esi, [eax]

###### 2.11.3. Permutation of Code Blocks
Permutation of Code Blocks : In this type of mutation, code blocks are randomly shuffled and then fixed up, so that execution logic is still the same.

This technique is very powerful.

###### 2.11.4. Insertion of Jump Instructions
Insertion of Jump Instructions : Some malware mutate by inserting jumps after instructions (the instruction is also relocated), so that the code flow does not change.

###### 2.11.5. Instruction Substitution
Instruction Substitution : In this type of mutation, one instruction (or set of instructions) are replaced by 1 or more different instructions which are functionally equivalent to the replaced set.

The example shows few example rules, which can be used for substitution.

**REG** stands for registered. **imm** stands for immediate number such as 0x800 (can be any numeric value). **imm8** stands for 1 byte (8 bits).

**Original CODE**
```
ADD   reg, imm
MOV   reg, reg/imm

SUB   reg, reg
TEST  reg, reg
LODSx

STOSx

CMD   reg, imm8
DEC   reg
INC   reg
```

**Transformed Code**
```
SUB   reg, -(imm)
PUSH  reg
POP   reg
XOR   reg, reg
OR    reg, reg
MOV   ACUM, [esi]
ADD   esi, SIZE
MOV   ACUM, [esi]
ADD   edi, SIZE
CMD   reg, imm32
SUB   reg, 1
ADD   reg, 1
```

###### 2.11.6. Code Integration with Host
In this type of mutation, the malware modifies the target executable (which is being infected) by spraying its code in regions of the EXE.

Zmist virus used this technique very effectively.

To hide more changes such as changes in file size, the malware might compress the original code (or can even damage the file completely) to change.



_______________________________________
## 3. How Malware Spreads
Malware basically spreads via a large number of mechanism such as:
- Email attachments
  We can change the extension from `.exe` into `.jpg` so that user will be tricked believing that it is an image

- Already infected files
  If you have been infected by a virus for a day, you need to think about what it might have already done during the 1-day time-frame. If the virus was the re-infection kind, then it must have infected numerous of other files, which open access/execution will activate the virus again. Once you are infected by a virus, it is then very hard to remove the infection from the system.

- Peer-2-peer file sharing
  Nowadays, around 30%-40% of all available files in file-sharing networks can be assumed to be infected with malware. Some of the clients are ad-supported or are pre-bundled with malware. They also may contain hidden backdoors (intentionally or unintentionally).

- Web-sites
  These kinds of attacks are also called drive-by-downloads. A website Y will exploit your browser in a way and then download the remaining part/body of the malware. Drive-by-downloads are triggered upon visiting a HTML page.

- Internet connection/Local network
  For example, there are some kind of glitches in Windows networking stack (Linux also has its own set of bugs) which are found time and time, and then rapidly exploited by malware to spread directly.

  Some of the known examples are RPC-DCOM vulnerability in Windows 2000/XP which was exploited on a very large scale all over the world.

  This kind of vulnerability do not require any user action. However, these kind of attacks can be stopped by using correctly configured firewalls or simply applying patches.

  Remember that we have written **Correctly configure firewalls** because a badly configured firewall does not offer any protection at all.

  However, do note that firewalls themselves have their own set of bugs, so they themselves can be vulnerable, so the best way to be protected is to update your software as soon as possible.

_______________________________________
## 4. Samples
#### 4.1. Keyloggers
The keyloggers provided is a simple Windows-based one.
This is a user mode CPU-intensive keylogger and certainly far behind the one
currently used. Our code fits in around 80 lines, while a very small keylogger
may fit in less than 50 lines of C code.

This keylogger is based on **GetAsyncKeyState** API. This function can be used
to obtain the state of any key on the keyboard asynchronously.

So, what we do is we check the state of all the keys of the keyboard one-at-a-time
and if the key-state is pressed then note it down.

```
while(1){
  for(i=8;i<=190;i++){
    // check keys from code 8 to code 190
    if (GetAsyncKeyState(i) == -32767){
      print_key(i);
    }
  } // end for
} // end while
```

#### 4.2. Trojan
The one we are covering here is the famous NetBus Trojan ver 1.7.
This trojan is supposed to be easily usable with lots of features.
The features list is:
- Open/Close CD-ROM
- How optional BMP/JPG image
- Swap mouse buttons
- Start optional applications
- Play music file
- Control mouse
- Shutdown Windows
- Show different types of messages to user
- Download / Upload / Delete files
- Go to an optional URL
- Send keystrokes an disable keys
- Listen for and send keystrokes
- Take screen-dump

If you want to test it, we advise you to use virtual OS.
Also what follows is the removal process.

Steps:
1. Find out the name of the NetBus-server (which is most often **Patch.exe**)
2. Run `Regedit.exe` and lookup the registry-key:
```
\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
  \CurrentVersion\Run
```
3. From that key, you should be able to sort out the NetBus server program
    (again, most often **Patch.exe**) from others.

  The offending program normally ends with `/nomsg`

4. When you have found the suspicious entry, do a file-search for
    **[Name of the bus server].exe** on your system
5. Finally, run: `[Name of the bus server].exe /remove`


#### 4.3. Virus
Virus detection is done by matching the patterns within virus code
with the database signature.

Below is given an open-source code for a Windows virus,
which is **Win32.Dissolution** (as detected by various antiviruses).

The virus spread by adding its code to the PE (Portable Executable) file and then
changing the entry-point to the virus body.
The virus does not try very hard to escape the Antiviruses.

Steps:
1. The virus gets the delta offset and save the starting location of the virus
2. The virus saves registers incase the host program needs them
3. Gets the location of the **kernel32.dll** in memory
4. Uses the **GetFunctionAddresses** procedure to get the **kernel32**
    API function addresses
5. Calls the **FindHostFile** procedure to find a valid PE file to infect
6. Calls the **GetHeader** procedure which reads the PE header into the memory
7. Calls the **AddCodeToHost** procedure which does many things:
    - Writes this program in memory to the end of the host file
    - Updates the last section header to include all the data up to the EOF by
      updating its virtual size, and makes it Readable/Writeable/Executable
    - Updates the program image size
    - Sets the entry point to the virus code
    - Adds a signature to location 79h to stop another function
    - Call **PutHeader** procedure which writes the updated PE Header to the host
8. Calls **AddtoRegistry** procedure which adds the last infected file to the registry
9. Restore registers for the host program
10. Returns control to the host program


However, you can easily check the strength of your antivirus by slightly
modifying the file and compiling it. You will be surprised by the results! E.g.:
```
RegistryName db 'Start-up Program', 0
Db 'Vorgon, Canada, 2003'          ; Signature
```
