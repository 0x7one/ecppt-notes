## 2.1. Password Spray Attack
Password Spray Attacks have quickly gained popularity as a *go-to* method for gaining access to systems via dictionary attacks due to its success-rate in the wild.

Rather than the usual dictionary brute force methods involving a dictionary of hundred of not millions of password entries, the idea is to reverse the process, and instead, introduce a list of as many *users* as possible, while trying just a *single password attempt* against tens or hundreds of user accounts.

This method reduces the potential of account lockouts and in some cases, allow us to stay *under the radar* when attempting single passwords against many users.

This method may also see referred to as [Reverse Brute-Force Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack#Reverse_brute-force_attack)

To successfully execute a password spray attack, we must first gather as many usernames as possible in regard to our target organization or target system.
